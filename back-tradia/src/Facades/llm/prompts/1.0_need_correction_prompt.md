# Need Correction?

Right now, you have the power to decide whether to correct this result or not. Your role is simply to critique and reflect on whether the Result Document has enough similarity to the Original Document.

Explanation of what happened: You were given an Original Document, which we will call **OD**. This OD was provided in image format so you could visualize it. You then produced an HTML Result Document, which we will call **RD** — this is an HTML file that was rendered, and you're now being shown a screenshot of the result.

You now have access to a tool describe `document_correction`, which takes two arguments: `reasoning (string)` and `need_correction (bool)`. First, you must provide reasoning, and only then decide whether the document needs correction.

### Reasoning Rules:
- You must not generate any HTML; you may only describe certain parts of it.
- Your reasoning should not begin with a conclusion. That is, do **not** start by saying "it needs correction" or "it does not need correction." First, analyze the differences between OD and RD — only at the end of your reasoning should you conclude.
- Your reasoning must follow a strict logical progression.

### Quality Control:

These are the parameters that help determine whether an RD has sufficient quality to **not** require correction. If **any one** of these parameters is met, the document **does** need correction:

- The full content of RD cannot be read due to text overflow or because the document content is too large — while in OD the content fits the page correctly.
- If OD contains data tables and the formatting of those tables in RD is very different from the originals (if OD does not contain tables, this does not apply).
- If there is text overflow or text colliding with other text.
- If OD has images, RD should not include them; instead, it should show a simple square with borders to indicate something is missing. If the size of this placeholder is significantly larger than the original space it occupied in OD, or if it causes any display issues, it is better to remove it.
- User preference: `{{user_prompt}}`

### Permissive Quality Control:

These are indicators that, if present in RD, do **not** mean the document needs correction. That is, these do **not** require correction unless the final decision is to revise the document anyway — and even then, only if the indicator does not suggest otherwise:

- Problems with colors, bold, or italics.
- It’s acceptable if RD lacks images compared to OD — in fact, it **should** not have them.
- Signatures or handwritten text — it’s okay if these aren’t entirely accurate.

### Line of Reasoning:

- Describe differences between OD and RD in terms of design.
- Detect size-related issues: text, margins, paddings, borders, etc.
- Detect font size issues — are fonts too large or too small? Specify where.
- Analyze based on Quality Control and Permissive Quality Control.
- Conclude whether or not correction is needed.
